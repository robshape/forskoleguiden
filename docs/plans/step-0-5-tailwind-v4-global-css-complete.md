# Plan Complete: Step 0.5 Tailwind v4 Global CSS

Step 0.5 is fully completed. Tailwind v4 global stylesheet wiring was introduced and verified with a temporary localized route, then the temporary route was cleaned up with evidence-based validation while preserving global CSS for future layout integration.

**Phases Completed**: 3 of 3

1. ✅ Phase 1: Add Global Tailwind Stylesheet
2. ✅ Phase 2: Temporary Swedish Page for Style Verification
3. ✅ Phase 3: Cleanup Temporary Verification Page
