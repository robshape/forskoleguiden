# Plan: Step 0.1 Astro Initialization

Initialize an Astro project in the repository root using the empty template, strict TypeScript, and pnpm so the project meets the Phase 1 scaffolding baseline. The work is split into small phases to keep setup safe in a non-empty repository and to verify all acceptance checks before moving forward.

## Phases

1. **Phase 1: Scaffold Astro Project**
    - **Objective**: Generate the Astro starter files in the current repository root with the required template and tooling selections.
    - **Files/Functions to Modify/Create**: package.json, tsconfig.json, astro.config.* (if generated by template), src/pages/index.astro and other starter files generated by Astro CLI.
    - **Tests to Write**: No unit tests required for CLI scaffolding; validate generated artifacts and dependency metadata through command checks.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Run Astro project initialization in the repository root using pnpm and the empty template.
        2. Select TypeScript strict mode and pnpm as package manager.
        3. Confirm generated project files are written without overwriting unrelated existing repository content.
        4. Verify package metadata includes Astro dependency.

2. **Phase 2: Validate Step 0.1 Acceptance Criteria**
    - **Objective**: Confirm strict TypeScript configuration and dev server startup behavior required by Step 0.1.
    - **Files/Functions to Modify/Create**: package.json, tsconfig.json (only if correction is needed).
    - **Tests to Write**: No new test files; run acceptance checks as executable validation.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Verify tsconfig contains strict TypeScript mode.
        2. Start the development server and confirm successful startup at localhost:4321.
        3. Capture command outputs for traceable verification.
        4. Apply minimal fixes only if acceptance checks fail.

3. **Phase 3: Update Memory Bank Status**
    - **Objective**: Record completion state for Step 0.1 in memory-bank tracking files.
    - **Files/Functions to Modify/Create**: docs/memory-bank/activeContext.md, docs/memory-bank/progress.md, docs/memory-bank/tasks/* if a task entry is required.
    - **Tests to Write**: No automated tests; validate documentation reflects current implementation status accurately.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Update active context to reflect completed Astro scaffolding.
        2. Update progress with Step 0.1 completion and next step reference.
        3. Keep updates concise and consistent with memory-bank conventions.

## Open Questions

1. None at this stage; implementation choices were confirmed by user approval.
