# Plan Complete: Initialize Memory Bank Core Files

Step 0.0 is fully complete. The required memory-bank structure and all seven core initialization files were created, then refined and validated against the implementation plan acceptance criteria. The resulting baseline now provides persistent project context for subsequent implementation steps.

**Phases Completed**: 3 of 3

1. ✅ Phase 1: Create memory-bank structure and baseline files
2. ✅ Phase 2: Refine and align documentation content
3. ✅ Phase 3: Verify acceptance criteria and consistency
