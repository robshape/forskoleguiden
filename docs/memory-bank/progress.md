# Progress

Current status: Step 0.2 is completed. Core production dependencies are installed (`@astrojs/preact`, `preact`, `@nanostores/preact`, `nanostores`, `lz-string`, `@astrojs/sitemap`) with pinned major ranges aligned to Astro 5, and installation verification is documented.

Next step is Step 0.3 (install development dependencies). Existing repository structure in `docs/` and `data/` remains preserved.
