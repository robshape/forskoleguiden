# Progress

Current status: Step 0.3 is completed. Development dependencies were installed and verified with `pnpm ls --dev --depth 0`, `npx vitest --version`, and `npx playwright --version`.

Next step is Step 0.4 (Astro config updates). Existing repository structure in `docs/` and `data/` remains preserved.
