# Progress

Current status: Step 0.1 is completed. The Astro scaffold is in place at repository root, strict TypeScript configuration is verified, and dev server startup on `http://localhost:4321/` is validated and recorded.

Next step is Step 0.2 (install core dependencies). Existing repository structure in `docs/` and `data/` remained preserved through Step 0.1.
