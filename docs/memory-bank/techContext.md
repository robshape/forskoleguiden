The project stack baseline is Astro (static output), TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS v4, and Preact islands with nanostores for cross-page client state, plus lz-string for compact shareable URL payloads. Quality tooling is planned around pnpm, Vitest, Playwright with axe, ESLint, and Prettier, with static deployment to GitHub Pages.
