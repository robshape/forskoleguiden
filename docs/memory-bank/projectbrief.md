# Project Brief

Förskoleguiden is a static, accessible, multilingual preschool comparison website for Malmö that helps parents evaluate options side by side using official 2025 survey data. The MVP centers on transparent comparison for the Helhetsbedömning group, a shortlist limited to five preschools, and shareable URL state without user accounts or backend services.

This file is a concise baseline for Step 0.0. For complete product scope, priorities, and milestone detail, use `docs/prd.md`; for architecture and implementation decisions, use `docs/tech-stack.md`.
